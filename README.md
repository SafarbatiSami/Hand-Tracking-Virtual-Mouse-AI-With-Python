# Hand-Tracking-Virtual-Mouse-AI-With-Python #

This project aims to develop a virtual mouse using hand tracking technology with **OpenCV, Mediapipe** and **PyAutogui**. The goal of the project is to create a system that can track hand movements in real-time and convert them into mouse cursor movements. The system will use a webcam or a built-in camera to capture the hand movements of the user and use OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries to analyze the video feed and extract the hand landmarks. Once the landmarks are detected, the system will use them to control the mouse cursor's movement, which will allow the user to interact with the computer without the need for a physical mouse.<br>
**NOTE**: Mediapipe supports the 64-bit version of Python 3.7 to 3.10 on windows <br>
To check your Python version, open command prompt and copy this : `python --version`
